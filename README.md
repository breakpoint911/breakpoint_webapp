**Note:** Remember to replace the placeholder links and contact information with your actual details. For the image paths in the "About Us" section (`assets/a.jpg` and `assets/b.jpg`), you'll need to add your own images to an `assets` folder in your project directory. If you don't, the `onerror` fallback will display a placeholder image.
